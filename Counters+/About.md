# Counters+
**Counters+** (Also known as CountersPlus) is a mod that enhances Beat Saber's UI with more statistics to display. Counters+ also boasts a large amount of configuration, all available from a custom made settings menu.

## Configuration
Counters+ has an easy to use, custom made settings menu that allows you to easily edit Counters+ to your preference, and preview your changes in real time.

To access this, go to the left screen, and click on the `Mods` button near the top. A menu should show up with different buttons relating to some of the different mods you have installed. A button in this menu will be labelled `Counters+`, and will lead you to the settings menu. If you plan on going in and out of the settings menu often, use the pin button at the bottom left of this screen to stick the button to the main menu for easier access.

## Custom Counters
Counters+ also supports the addition of custom counters. Other mods can input counters of their own into the Counters+ system, and allow the user to edit the positioning of the counter, just like any Counters+ counter!
